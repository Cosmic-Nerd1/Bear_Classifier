# Bear_Classifier

A Deep learning model used for deployment on an application.\
Model uses fastai library which in my opinion suits nicely for such models to train and test.\
Also this uses fastBook where we could find many methods used here.\
We used duckduckgo.com browser here to carry out our images downloading for filling our database.

This model deals with 5 types of bears which most often a normal computer may get confused....\
These are :
1. Black Bears
2. Grizzly Bears
3. Teddy Bears
4. Polar Bears
5. Pandas\
when we train our model with the computer vision deep learning technique it gets to understand how do all these bears differ from each other.\
After the training...For testing I have enabled an upload option for getting an image from user and then based on training predicting it to be of the correct catorgory of bears.

The results are 99% accurate so we can realy on it....

This model can be used for deployment in an application in which we can share an image or click an image through camera of any type of bear which falls in the range we have trained our model into.....this can be a web app or android app or ios app....
