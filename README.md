# Bear_Classifier

A Deep learning model used for deployment on a application.\
Model uses fastai library which in my opinion suits nicely for such models to train and test.\
Also this uses fastBook where we could find many methods used here.\
We used duckduckgo.com browser here to carry out our images downloading for filling our database.

This model deals with 3 types of bears which most often a normal computer may get confused....\
These are :
1. Black Bears
2. Grizzly Bears
3. Teddy Bears
